Contributions are welcome!
==========================

Code, comments, bug reports and more.

By contributing to this repo, the contributor transfers the 
copyright of the contribution to ASSA ABLOY AB.

We want the whole project to have a unified copyright. This enables us to,
for example, update the license of the project. Handling individual parts
with different copyright holders would not be cumbersome. Let's use our
energy to produce good, working code, instead.
